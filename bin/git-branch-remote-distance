# Usage:
# $ git-branch-distance master    # Compare the specified branch to its remote
# $ git-branch-distance           # Compare the current branch to its remote
#
# Output:
# First line is how many commits ahead the main branch is
# Second line is how many commits behind the main branch is


# Main branch, default to the current branch
